Replication package of our paper that compares de energy efficiency of Python and C++ for ROS 2 projetcs.

## Monitoring the Energy Consumption

For monitoring the energy consumption, we are going to use the `energy-mon.py` script as superuser (root).

```
# python3 energy-mon.py <script> <language>
